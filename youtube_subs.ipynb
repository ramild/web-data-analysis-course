      "Most people are  optimistic in the short-term and pessimistic in the long-term. And what I've learned,  is you actually need to be exactly the opposite of that. True founders need to be  pessimistic in the short-term, and long-term optimistic. It's surprising, it's weird,  but let me explain why. Let's get into it. One of the things I learned  in therapy about myself is that I actually have an  incredibly overactive super ego, more so than most people. A super ego is the part of a person's mind that acts as a self critical conscience. I grew up as a child  of Chinese immigrants. Really, anyone growing up  in a super strict household would have that same response. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have some good news for you,  if that's the case, though, this can be an asset. Here's Andy Grove, from his book, \"Only The Paranoid Survive.\" He says, \"I believe in  the value of paranoia. Business success contains the  seeds of its own destruction. The more successful you are, the more people want a  chunk of your business, then another chunk, and then another, until there's nothing left. The things I tend to  be paranoid about vary, I worry about products getting screwed up, and I worry about products  getting introduced prematurely. I worry about factories  not performing well, and I worry about having  too many factories, I worry about hiring the right people, and I worry about morale slacking off. And of course, I worry about competitors. I worry about other people figuring out how to do what we do better or cheaper, and displacing us with our customers.\" For me, the challenge is actually  to channel this super ego, the anxiety, the stress, all of those things,  into productive action. It's not enough to ask  what could go wrong, the next step is important too. It's to ask yourself, \"What do I need to do to  prevent that from happening?\" If you get frozen in anxiety and stress, you do nothing to help yourself, and your paranoia and pessimism turn into self-fulfilling prophecy. and this is actually the core  seed of the Stockdale Paradox, and I already made a  whole video about that. You've got to have faith  that you will prevail, with the discipline to  confront the brutal facts of your current reality,  whatever that might be. I put a link in the description, if you haven't seen that yet. This is also why Charlie  Munger famously said, \"All I want to know is  where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.\" Pay attention to your  anxiety, don't throw it away. It's telling you something  that's very important. Short-term pessimism will lead you to do the right things for your business. Because it'll allow you to perceive that which  might hold you back, you've got to listen. \n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out, and this  is very surprising to me, short-term optimism kills. And the vast majority of people who try to start their startups are overwhelmingly short-term optimists. If you've got to temper  it for a very good reason, it will hurt you. In January 2019, researchers at the London  School of Economics actually tracked the  earnings of entrepreneurs from when they were  employees for a company until after they started  their own businesses. Here's the weird stat. Founders with above average optimism earned more than their  pessimistic counterparts when they were employees. But, when they made the  jump to entrepreneurship, they earned 30% less than the more pessimistic  business owners, 30% . Short-term optimism is necessary, but that's why it's also dangerous. This is why many people work on startups, but most of them will fail. Here's one of my favorite  clips about startup ideas from the 1999 movie, \"Office Space.\" - You know, there are people in this world that don't have to put  up with all this shit. Like that guy that invented the Pet Rock, you see, that's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some  really great idea like that, and you can make millions, never have to work again. - You think that Pet Rock  was a really great idea? - Sure it was, the guy made $1 million. You know, I had an idea like  that once, a long time ago. - Really, what was it, Tom? - Well, all right. It was a jump to conclusions mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor, and would have different  conclusions written on it that you could jump to. - That is the worst idea I've  ever heard in my life, Tom. - Yes, this is a horrible, this idea. - You have to understand that most people don't want to tell you that it's not going to work. What happened in \"Office Space\" tends not to be what  happens to us in real life. Be careful with this. I'm not saying you should  try to become discouraged. I am saying you should  pay extra close attention to the criticisms and reasons  why things might not work, then do your best through product, design and business strategy to actually address those things. This is also why talking with users is the true litmus test. Users will vote with their feet, they might tell you to your  face that they like it, but if you look down, and you don't have dollars in your hand or a completed transaction, then you have your real answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, you need long-term optimism. And this is actually pretty hard. Most people really aren't ready to strap in for the 10 years it takes. 80% of new businesses fail  in the first five years, and another 80% fail  in the next five years. If you can last 10 years, you're going to be in the  top 4% of all companies. Success actually takes forever, and to succeed, you've got to be the longest  term optimist there is. There is one of my favorite  Bill Gates' quotes is this. \"Most people overestimate what  they can achieve in a year, and underestimate what they  can achieve in 10 years.\" At Y Combinator we refer  to this as the process. First, you start off with the  initial glee of the launch, then a long trough of sorrow. A great many of you are in the  trough of sorrow right now. And here are the ways to get through it. The next stage says it all,  releases of improvement. Eventually, you can  reach the promised land. As W.B. Prescott said, \"In any contest between  power and patience, bet on patience.\" And that's the key. Short-term pessimism will  get you to hyper focus on the things that will  help you avoid death. But long-term optimism  will get you committed for the long haul. So you'll actually do the things necessary to compound your growth and achieve what at  first seemed impossible. Remember, none of this comes naturally. You've got to apply  conscious attention and focus if you're to break out of  the natural inclinations that hold the vast  majority of people back. You've got this. That's it for this week. Thanks again for watching  all the way to the end. If you like this, I hope  you'll take a moment to check out one of our  startups called Knowable, at Knowable.fyi. They've got some amazing  audio courses right now, like how to Think on Your Feet, How to do improv by the  Upright Citizens Brigade. There's actually a ton of overlap between being a startup founder and thinking on your feet  like an improv comedian. You can get 25% off if you  use my discount code, Garry with two R's. And, as always, don't forget, tell your friends about this channel, especially people who might  be your future co-founder, click like, and hit  subscribe and hit the bell, so you can join my notifications  next time I post a video. I've been doing live chats lately and answering all of your questions live in front of the whole  audience on my premieres. So, I hope you'll join  us for the next one, and thanks for keeping me honest. I've been trying to keep up with a weekly content schedule, sometimes a few times a week.

      "{'video_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NYrsE_yW64', 'video_id': '9NYrsE_yW64', 'text': 'Most people are  optimistic in the short-term and pessimistic in the long-term. And what I\\'ve learned,  is you actually need to be exactly the opposite of that. True founders need to be  pessimistic in the short-term, and long-term optimistic. It\\'s surprising, it\\'s weird,  but let me explain why. Let\\'s get into it. One of the things I learned  in therapy about myself is that I actually have an  incredibly overactive super ego, more so than most people. A super ego is the part of a person\\'s mind that acts as a self critical conscience. I grew up as a child  of Chinese immigrants. Really, anyone growing up  in a super strict household would have that same response. I have some good news for you,  if that\\'s the case, though, this can be an asset. Here\\'s Andy Grove, from his book, \"Only The Paranoid Survive.\" He says, \"I believe in  the value of paranoia. Business success contains the  seeds of its own destruction. The more successful you are, the more people want a  chunk of your business, then another chunk, and then another, until there\\'s nothing left. The things I tend to  be paranoid about vary, I worry about products getting screwed up, and I worry about products  getting introduced prematurely. I worry about factories  not performing well, and I worry about having  too many factories, I worry about hiring the right people, and I worry about morale slacking off. And of course, I worry about competitors. \\n\\nI worry about other people figuring out how to do what we do better or cheaper, and displacing us with our customers.\" For me, the challenge is actually  to channel this super ego, the anxiety, the stress, all of those things,  into productive action. It\\'s not enough to ask  what could go wrong, the next step is important too. It\\'s to ask yourself, \"What do I need to do to  prevent that from happening?\" If you get frozen in anxiety and stress, you do nothing to help yourself, and your paranoia and pessimism turn into self-fulfilling prophecy. and this is actually the core  seed of the Stockdale Paradox, and I already made a  whole video about that. You\\'ve got to have faith  that you will prevail, with the discipline to  confront the brutal facts of your current reality,  whatever that might be. I put a link in the description, if you haven\\'t seen that yet. This is also why Charlie  Munger famously said, \"All I want to know is  where I\\'m going to die, so I\\'ll never go there.\" Pay attention to your  anxiety, don\\'t throw it away. It\\'s telling you something  that\\'s very important. Short-term pessimism will lead you to do the right things for your business. Because it\\'ll allow you to perceive that which  might hold you back, you\\'ve got to listen. It turns out, and this  is very surprising to me, short-term optimism kills. And the vast majority of people who try to start their startups are overwhelmingly short-term optimists. If you\\'ve got to temper  it for a very good reason, it will hurt you. In January 2019, researchers at the London  School of Economics actually tracked the  earnings of entrepreneurs from when they were  employees for a company until after they started  their own businesses. Here\\'s the weird stat. Founders with above average optimism earned more than their  pessimistic counterparts when they were employees. But, when they made the  jump to entrepreneurship, they earned 30% less than the more pessimistic  business owners, 30% . Short-term optimism is necessary, but that\\'s why it\\'s also dangerous. This is why many people work on startups, but most of them will fail. Here\\'s one of my favorite  clips about startup ideas from the 1999 movie, \"Office Space.\" - You know, there are people in this world that don\\'t have to put  up with all this shit. Like that guy that invented the Pet Rock, you see, that\\'s what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some  really great idea like that, and you can make millions, never have to work again. - You think that Pet Rock  was a really great idea? - Sure it was, the guy made $1 million. You know, I had an idea like  that once, a long time ago. - Really, what was it, Tom? - Well, all right. It was a jump to conclusions mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor, and would have different  conclusions written on it that you could jump to. - That is the worst idea I\\'ve  ever heard in my life, Tom. - Yes, this is a horrible, this idea. - You have to understand that most people don\\'t want to tell you that it\\'s not going to work. What happened in \"Office Space\" tends not to be what  happens to us in real life. Be careful with this. I\\'m not saying you should  try to become discouraged. I am saying you should  pay extra close attention to the criticisms and reasons  why things might not work, then do your best through product, design and business strategy to actually address those things. This is also why talking with users is the true litmus test. \\n\\nUsers will vote with their feet, they might tell you to your  face that they like it, but if you look down, and you don\\'t have dollars in your hand or a completed transaction, then you have your real answer. Next, you need long-term optimism. And this is actually pretty hard. Most people really aren\\'t ready to strap in for the 10 years it takes. 80% of new businesses fail  in the first five years, and another 80% fail  in the next five years. If you can last 10 years, you\\'re going to be in the  top 4% of all companies. Success actually takes forever, and to succeed, you\\'ve got to be the longest  term optimist there is. There is one of my favorite  Bill Gates\\' quotes is this. \"Most people overestimate what  they can achieve in a year, and underestimate what they  can achieve in 10 years.\" At Y Combinator we refer  to this as the process. First, you start off with the  initial glee of the launch, then a long trough of sorrow. A great many of you are in the  trough of sorrow right now. And here are the ways to get through it. The next stage says it all,  releases of improvement. Eventually, you can  reach the promised land. As W.B. Prescott said, \"In any contest between  power and patience, bet on patience.\" And that\\'s the key. Short-term pessimism will  get you to hyper focus on the things that will  help you avoid death. But long-term optimism  will get you committed for the long haul. So you\\'ll actually do the things necessary to compound your growth and achieve what at  first seemed impossible. Remember, none of this comes naturally. You\\'ve got to apply  conscious attention and focus if you\\'re to break out of  the natural inclinations that hold the vast  majority of people back. You\\'ve got this. That\\'s it for this week. Thanks again for watching  all the way to the end. If you like this, I hope  you\\'ll take a moment to check out one of our  startups called Knowable, at Knowable.fyi. They\\'ve got some amazing  audio courses right now, like how to Think on Your Feet, How to do improv by the  Upright Citizens Brigade. There\\'s actually a ton of overlap between being a startup founder and thinking on your feet  like an improv comedian. You can get 25% off if you  use my discount code, Garry with two R\\'s. And, as always, don\\'t forget, tell your friends about this channel, especially people who might  be your future co-founder, click like, and hit  subscribe and hit the bell, so you can join my notifications  next time I post a video. I\\'ve been doing live chats lately and answering all of your questions live in front of the whole  audience on my premieres. So, I hope you\\'ll join  us for the next one, and thanks for keeping me honest. I\\'ve been trying to keep up with a weekly content schedule, sometimes a few times a week. It\\'s really hard, but  I\\'m having a ton of fun. I hope this is useful for you all. I\\'ll catch you next week.'}\n"
